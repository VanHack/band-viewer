# Band Viewer

Project created for Vanhackathon 2017.

## Base Requirements

Create a single-page web application that takes an artist from the user and returns details about the artist and their events. The aim of the code challenge is to be able to understand the decisions made in building a web application. Focus on the requirements first and if you have extra time feel free to add bonus features. In the end we will review your submission in terms of its readability, architecture and creativity.

Create a web application using html, css and js along with any framework/libraries of your choice. The web application being created will be used to take an artist and show details about the artist and their events.

The application should contain at least the following UI:

- A way to input the artist’s name.
- Show results based on the input of the artist’s name:
  - Artist Name
  - Artist Picture
  - Artist Facebook URL
  - Artist Events
- Event Venue
- Event City
- Event Country
- Event Date
